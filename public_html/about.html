   <h2>Our Mission</h2>
        <p>We are a small company devoted to the highest quality mountain bikes and accessories. 
        In our quest for quality, we have also collected information on our favorite local trails, for your convenience.</p>
   <h2>History</h2>
        <p>The company was started by Malac Blaser and Ryan Dille. Though it may have originally been created for the sole sake of passing a class, it soon became something more.
        Since the fateful day that assignment was given, the company has staked its niche in Iowa biking. 
        We have numerous locations around Iowa. Despite our rapid growth, we are still dedicated to the small town feel that has come to be expected of Mountain Bike Club.</p>

   <p>We are dedicated to the expansion of the mountain biking sport. Please feel free to contact us for help starting your own biking club! For those of you that prefer a motor do your peddling for you be glad to hear that we will soon expand our business into the motorcycle world.</p>
   
   <h2>Future Plans</h2>
   
   <p>Be assured that we will never drop our roots in the mountain biking business. We are at a critical moment in our business where we have been given the opportunity to expand into the motorcycle world. In the next few years you can look forward to seeing our custom made motorcycles hit the streets all across America.</p>
