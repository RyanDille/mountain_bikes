  <h2>Top 3 Trails</h2>
  
  <img src="pics/court_hill.png" alt="Court Hill" />
  
  <p>Our top locations attract hundreds of thousands of people every year. Trails we recommend are maintained by the states parks and rec department run by Leslie Knope.</p>
  
  
  <h2>Alternate Locations</h2>
  
  <p>Duck Creek, Sunderbruch Park, Ada Hayden Heritage Park, Ewing Park, Brown's Woods, and Raccoon River Park</p>
  <p>At all of our bike trails we have a Mountain Bike Club facility. This facility organizes club meetings and is where you go if you want to join a club. 
  These facilities also allow members limited lodging if necessary. Please contact us about any extended stays you may need.</p>
  <p>These locations also have a 24/7 park ranger at all of our locations to guarantee your safety at all times. 
  All of our parks are also open to the public so you can swim, fish, hike, camp, and much more. 
  Whether your planning a bike trip with friends or family, or just want to meet up with random people and join a club, we can help you find amazing places to ride near you.</p>
