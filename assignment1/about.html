   <p class="col-xs-12">We are a small company devoted to the highest quality mountain bikes and accessories. In our quest for quality, we have also collected information on our favorite local trails, for your convenience. <br />  </p>
   <p class="col-xs-12">The company was started by Malac Blaser and Ryan Dille. Though it may have originally been created for the sole sake of passing a class, it soon became something more.<br />Since the fateful day that assignment was given, the company has staked its niche in Iowa biking. We have numerous locations around Iowa. Despite our rapid <br /> growth, we are still dedicated to the small town feel that has come to be expected of Mountain Bike Club.  </p>
